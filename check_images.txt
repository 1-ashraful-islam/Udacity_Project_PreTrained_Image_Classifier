Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

My results for the uploaded images are as follows:
            Not a dog   Dog         Breed       matches
AlexNet:    100.00%     100.00%     0.00%       25.00%
ResNet:     100.00%     100.00%     0.00%       25.00%
VGG:        100.00%     100.00%     0.00%       25.00%

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, all three model architectures classified the dog breed to be the same breed.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, all three model architectures classified the dog breed to be the same breed for both images.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, all three model architecture correctly classified "not dog images" to be "not dog images".


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: It is difficult to select the best model architecture based on the uploaded images as they all have same result stats.
Only difference in results is the tea cup labled as "cup" by resnet, while "coffee mug" by alexnet and vgg.
However, based on the performance on the test set I would select VGG as the best model architecture for the uploaded images.
Although, time taken by VGG is more than the other two, for a small dataset this would not be an issue but this would be something to keep in mind if the data set is large.
